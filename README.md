The Wakan Programming Language
==============================

Wakan is a small programming language designed as an educational project.
It was not designed for any particular application and is not complete.

This is a rather crude implementation of Wakan. It is not trying to be very efficient and
its use in any critical application is not recommended. If you want to support the project however,
you are free to report any bugs or suggestions by creating a new issue.

You can try out the language in your browser: https://wakan.rolandb.com/

## Hello world

The "Hello world" program of this language looks like this:
```
write "Hello world!\n"
```
